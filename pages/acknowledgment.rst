Usage of images from the Sky Viewer
===================================

The Legacy Surveys Sky Viewer web sites `viewer.legacysurvey.org <http://viewer.legacysurvey.org>`_ and
`legacysurvey.org/viewer <https://www.legacysurvey.org/viewer>`_ provide images from a number of surveys
who have publicly released their data. Each survey has its own copyright and licensing terms, links to
which are available in the bottom-right corner of the viewer web page.

Links to these surveys' image use policies and licensing terms are provided here as a courtesy.  We do
not guarantee these are the relevant documents; most surveys have statements about images published on
their web sites, but not on renderings produced from their public data releases. For any usage of images,
the user is responsible for ensuring that they are in compliance with any licensing terms for the relevant layer.

Scientific Publication Acknowledgment
=====================================

When using data from the Legacy Surveys in papers, please use the following acknowledgment:

The Legacy Surveys consist of three individual and complementary projects: the Dark Energy Camera
Legacy Survey (DECaLS; Proposal ID #2014B-0404; PIs: David Schlegel and Arjun Dey),
the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey (BASS; NOAO Prop. ID #2015A-0801; PIs: Zhou Xu and Xiaohui
Fan), and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS; Prop. ID #2016A-0453; PI: Arjun
Dey). DECaLS, BASS and MzLS together include data obtained, respectively, at the Blanco telescope,
Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, NSF’s NOIRLab;
the Bok telescope, Steward Observatory, University of Arizona; and the
Mayall telescope, Kitt Peak National Observatory, NOIRLab.
Pipeline processing and analyses of the data were supported by NOIRLab and the
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The Legacy Surveys project is honored
to be permitted to conduct astronomical research on Iolkam Du’ag (Kitt Peak),
a mountain with particular significance to the Tohono O’odham Nation.

NOIRLab is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.
LBNL is managed by the Regents of the University of California under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy.

This project used data obtained with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), which was constructed by
the Dark Energy Survey (DES) collaboration. Funding for the DES Projects has been provided by
the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Ministry of Science
and Education of Spain, the Science and Technology Facilities Council of the United Kingdom,
the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the Kavli Institute of
Cosmological Physics at the University of Chicago, Center for Cosmology and Astro-Particle
Physics at the Ohio State University, the Mitchell Institute for Fundamental Physics and
Astronomy at Texas A&M University, Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos, Fundacao Carlos
Chagas Filho de Amparo, Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos, Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho
de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Cientifico e Tecnologico and the Ministerio da Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacao, the
Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the Collaborating Institutions in the Dark Energy Survey.
The Collaborating Institutions are Argonne National Laboratory, the University of California
at Santa Cruz, the University of Cambridge, Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas,
Medioambientales y Tecnologicas-Madrid, the University of Chicago, University College
London, the DES-Brazil Consortium, the University of Edinburgh, the Eidgenossische
Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zurich, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the Institut de Ciencies de l’Espai (IEEC/CSIC), the
Institut de Fisica d’Altes Energies, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the
Ludwig Maximilians Universitat Munchen and the associated Excellence Cluster Universe,
the University of Michigan, NSF’s NOIRLab, the University
of Nottingham, the Ohio State University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University
of Portsmouth, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University, the University of
Sussex, and Texas A&M University.

BASS is a key project of the Telescope Access Program (TAP), which has been funded by the
National Astronomical Observatories of China, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (the Strategic
Priority Research Program “The Emergence of Cosmological Structures” Grant # XDB09000000),
and the Special Fund for Astronomy from the Ministry of Finance. The BASS is also supported
by the External Cooperation Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant # 114A11KYSB20160057),
and Chinese National Natural Science Foundation (Grant # 12120101003, # 11433005).

The Legacy Survey team makes use of data products from the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared
Survey Explorer (NEOWISE), which is a project of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute
of Technology. NEOWISE is funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

The Legacy Surveys imaging of the DESI footprint is supported by the Director, Office of Science,
Office of High Energy Physics of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH1123,
by the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, a DOE Office of Science User Facility
under the same contract; and by the U.S. National Science Foundation, Division of Astronomical
Sciences under Contract No. AST-0950945 to NOAO.
