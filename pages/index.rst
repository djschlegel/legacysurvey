   <h1>The DECam Legacy Survey</h1>


.. container:: col-md-6 col-left

   The Legacy Survey is producing an inference model catalog of the sky
   from a set of optical and infrared imaging data, comprising
   14,000 deg\ |sup2| of extragalactic sky
   visible from the northern hemisphere in three optical bands (g,r,z)
   and four infrared bands.
   The sky coverage is approximately bounded by -18\ |deg| < |delta| < +84\ |deg|
   in celestial coordinates and :math:`|b|` > 18\ |deg| in Galactic coordinates.
   The DECam Legacy Survey is providing these data in the equatorial
   region at |delta| < +30\ |deg| using the Dark Energy Camera on the Blanco Telescope.
