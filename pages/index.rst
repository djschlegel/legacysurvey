   The DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys conducted dedicated observations to produce an inference model of 
   14,000 square degrees of extragalactic sky visible from the northern hemisphere in three optical bands
   (:math:`g,r,z`) and four infrared bands.  The sky coverage was approximately bounded by
   -18\ |deg| < |delta| < +84\ |deg| in celestial coordinates and :math:`|b|` > 18\
   |deg| in Galactic coordinates. To achieve this goal, the Legacy Surveys completed
   three imaging projects on different telescopes, described in more depth at the following links:

   ========================================== ===================================== ===========================================
   *The Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey* (`BASS`_) *The DECam Legacy Survey* (`DECaLS`_) *The Mayall z-band Legacy Survey* (`MzLS`_)
   ========================================== ===================================== ===========================================

   An overview of the surveys is available in `Dey et al. (2019)`_. The Legacy Surveys are currently being
   augmented to incorporate additional DECam data reduced by the `NOIRLab Community Pipeline`_. Goals include extending the
   footprint further south, adding observations from other optical bands, and creating a consistent inference model over a larger area.
