This gallery highlights the exquisite image quality and diversity
of objects observed by the Legacy Survey, including planetary nebulae, globular clusters, and
large, nearby galaxies.  Each thumbnail links to a larger image while the object name below each
thumbnail links to the `Sky Viewer`_.  For reference, the horizontal white bar in
the lower-right corner of each image represents one arcminute.

We gratefully acknowledge the OpenNGC_ catalog created by Mattia Verga, which was used to generate this sample.
