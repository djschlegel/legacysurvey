The Legacy Surveys are producing an inference model of the 14,000 square degrees
of extragalactic sky visible from the northern hemisphere in three optical bands
(:math:`g,r,z`) and four infrared bands.  The sky coverage is approximately bounded by
-18\ |deg| < |delta| < +84\ |deg| in celestial coordinates and :math:`|b|` > 18\
|deg| in Galactic coordinates. To achieve this goal, the Legacy Surveys are conducting
3 imaging projects on different telescopes, described in more depth at the following links:

Contents of DR6
===============

Data Release 6 (DR6) is the sixth public data release of the Legacy Surveys. It is the
second public release of images and catalogs that combine the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey
and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (`BASS`_ and `MzLS`_; `DR5`_ comprised the fourth 
release of data from `DECaLS`_). Imaging from the Legacy Surveys is first reduced
through the `NOAO Community Pipeline`_ before being processed using the `Tractor`_.

DR6 includes `BASS`_ images taken prior to June 25, 2017 and `MzLS`_ images taken
prior to December 9, 2017. For the latest `DECaLS`_ images, see `DR5`_ of the Legacy 
Surveys. The `BASS`_ and `MzLS`_ data in DR6 are reduced in a manner that is largely
consistent with `DECaLS`_ reductions in `DR5`_.

In total, the optical data in DR6 covers a disjoint footprint
with, roughly, 4400 deg\ |sup2| having at least one observation
in :math:`g`-band, 4400 deg\ |sup2| having at least one observation
in :math:`r`-band and 5300 deg\ |sup2| having at least one observation
in :math:`z`-band. A total of about 3900 deg\ |sup2| is covered by at least one 
observation in *all three* optical filters. These are coarse estimates based
on intersections with `HEALPixels`_ of *NSIDE=4096* (about 0.74 arcmin\ |sup2|).
The area included in DR6 is depicted on the `status page`_.

DR6 includes the stacked images and the Tractor-based catalogs.
The size of the DR6 data distribution is:

========== ============ =======================
Size*       Directory    Description
========== ============ =======================
30 GB      `calib/`_    Calibration files.
9.0 TB     `coadd/`_    Co-added images, including |chi|\ |sup2|, depth, image, model, nexp, and Quality Assurance PNG plots
8.8 GB     `external/`_ Matches to other catalogs (SDSS, etc.).
??? MB     `gallery/`_  Images of notable galaxies (NGC, etc.).
22 GB      `logs/`_     Log files generated by Tractor processing.
182 GB     `metrics/`_  Metrics.
147 GB     `sweep/`_    Repackaged versions of the Tractor catalogs.
449 GB     `tractor/`_  Tractor catalogs.
========== ============ =======================

\*Note that although the *contents* of a directory should be fixed for each Data Release, 
the *size* of a directory can change. This is typically due to updated file compression. 
So, the listed directory sizes should be viewed as (very reasonable) estimates.

For all of the Legacy Surveys, including `BASS`_ and `MzLS`_, co-added images and
`Tractor`_ catalogs are presented in "bricks" of approximate
size 0.25\ |deg| |times| 0.25\ |deg|.  Each brick is defined in terms of a box in RA,Dec
coordinates.  For the image stacks, we use a simple tangent-plane (WCS TAN)
projection around the brick center. The projections for the :math:`g,r,z` filters are identical.
There are 662,174 bricks spread over the sky, meaning that each brick has an average
area of 0.0623 deg\ :sup:`2`\ . The brick images have some overlap.
The co-added images should be
used with caution, as noted below in the *Image Stacks* section.

There are approximately 310 million unique sources in DR6 spread over 92,287 bricks.


Obtaining Images and Raw Data
==============================

Images from all 3 of the Legacy Surveys can be viewed directly using 
`the Sky viewer`_ and raw data can be obtained through `the NOAO portal`_ 
(or via ftp; see also the information near
the bottom of the `files`_ page).

Sections of `DECaLS`_ for DR6 can be obtained as JPEGs or FITS files using
the cutout service, as follows:

JPEG: http://legacysurvey.org/viewer/jpeg-cutout?ra=190.1086&dec=1.2005&layer=decals-???&pixscale=0.27&bands=grz

FITS: http://legacysurvey.org/viewer/fits-cutout?ra=190.1086&dec=1.2005&layer=decals-???&pixscale=0.27&bands=grz

where "bands" is a string such as ":math:`grz`",":math:`gz`",":math:`g`", etc.  As of the
writing of this documentation the maximum size for cutouts (in number of pixels) is 512.
Pixscale=0.262 will return (approximately) the native pixels used by the `Tractor`_.
For information on how to recover `DECaLS`_ cutouts, see the `DR5 description`_ page.

Source Detection
================

The source detection uses a PSF- and SED-matched-filter detection on
the stacked images, with a 6\ |sigma| detection limit.
The `Tractor`_ fitting step is initialized with these positions, although
these positions can be changed during the fits and
low-S/N sources can be removed.

For source detection, each image is convolved by its PSF model, then a weighted stack
of these is created in order to optimize the point-source detection
efficiency.  Next, SED-matched combinations of the three bands are
created, for two SEDs: "flat" (a source with AB color zero), and
"red", a source with AB color :math:`g-r = 1`, :math:`r-z = 1`.  Sources above 6\ |sigma|
are detected in each of these two SED-matched filters, as well as in each band independently.

As of `DR5`_, source detection is run first in :math:`z`, then in :math:`r`, :math:`g`, "flat"
and finally in "red". In `DR4`_, `DR3`_ and earlier data releases,
source detection was run first in :math:`g`, then in :math:`r`, :math:`z`, "flat"
and finally in "red".

PSF
===

The `Tractor`_ makes use of the PSF on each individual exposure. The PSF for
the individual exposures are first computed independently for each CCD
using PSFEx_, generating spatially-varying pixelized models.

The configuaration files for SExtractor and PSFex that we used for a given
iteration of our codebase are available `on our github page`_.

.. _`PSFEx`: http://www.astromatic.net/software/psfex
.. _`on our github page`: https://github.com/legacysurvey/legacypipe-dir/tree/master/calib/se-config

Sky Level
=========

The Community Pipeline removes a sky level that includes a sky pattern, an illumination 
correction, and a single scaled fringe pattern. These steps are described on the 
`NOAO Community Pipeline`_ page. This makes the sky level in the processed images near 
zero, and removes most pattern artifacts. A constant sky level is then added back to the 
image that is the mean of what was removed.

Additionally, we compute and remove a spatially varying (spline) sky
model, by detecting and masking sources, then computing medians in
sliding 512-pixel boxes. 

Tractor Catalogs
================

The `Tractor`_ code runs within the geometrical region
of a brick. This fitting is performed on the individual exposures
that overlap the brick, without making use of the image stacks.
This preserves the full information content of the data set in the fits,
handles masked pixels without the need for uncertain interpolation techniques,
and fits to data points without the complication of pixel covariances.

Morphological Classification
============================

The `Tractor`_ fitting can allow any of the source properties or
image calibration parameters (such as the PSF) to float.
Only the source properties were allowed to float in DR6.
These are continuous properties for the object centers, fluxes,
and the shape parameters. 

There is also the discrete choice of which
model type to use. In DR6, five morphological types are used: point sources,
round exponential galaxies with a variable radius ("REX"), deVaucouleurs profiles
(elliptical galaxies), exponential profiles (spiral galaxies), and composite
profiles that are deVaucouleurs + exponential (with the same source center).
The total numbers of the different morphological types in DR6 are:

================= ==================
Number of Sources Type
================= ==================
   313,512,903    Objects in a Primary brick
   121,854,427    ``PSF``
   139,736,335    ``REX``
    26,804,729    ``EXP``
    22,741,635    ``DEV``
     2,375,777    ``COMP``
================= ==================

Note that, as of `DR5`_, the "REX" model replaced the "SIMP" model used in
`DR4`_, `DR3`_ and earlier data releases.

The decision to retain an object in the catalog and to re-classify it using
models more complicated than a point source is made using the penalized
changes to |chi|\ |sup2| in the image after subtracting the models for other sources.
The "PSF" and "REX" models are computed for every source and the better of these 
two is used when deciding whether to keep the source. A source is retained if its 
penalized |chi|\ |sup2| is improved by 25; this corresponds to a |chi|\ |sup2| 
difference of 27 (because of the penalty of 2 for the source centroid). Sources 
below this threshold are removed. 

The source is classified as the better of "point source (PSF)" or "round exponential 
galaxy (REX)" unless the penalized |chi|\ |sup2| is improved by 9 (*i.e.*, 
approximately a 3\ |sigma| improvement) by treating it as a deVaucouleurs or 
exponential profile. The classification is a composite of deVaucouleurs + exponential 
if it is both a better fit to a single profile over the point source, and the composite 
improves the penalized |chi|\ |sup2| by another 9. These choices implicitly mean
that any extended source classifications have to be at least 5.8\ |sigma| detections
and that composite profiles must be at least 6.5\ |sigma| detections.

The fluxes are not constrained to be positive-valued.  This allows the fitting of 
very low signal-to-noise sources without introducing biases at the faint end.  It 
also allows the stacking of fluxes at the catalog level.


Tractor Implementation Details
==============================

`Tractor`_ fundamentally treats the fitting as a |chi|\ |sup2| minimization
problem.  The current core routine uses the sparse least squares
solver from the `SciPy`_ package, or the open source
`Ceres solver`_, originally developed by Google.

The galaxy profiles (the exponential and deVaucouleurs profiles mentioned above
under *Morphological Classification*) are approximated with `mixture-of-gaussian`_ 
(MoG) models and are convolved by the pixelized PSF models using a new 
Fourier-space method (Lang, in prep).
The galaxy profile approximation introduces errors in these
models typically at the level of :math:`10^{-4}` or smaller.
The PSF models are treated as pixel-convolved quantities,
and are evaluated at the integral pixel coordinates without integrating
any functions over the pixels.

The Tractor algorithm could be run with both the source parameters
and the calibration parameters allowed to float, at the cost of
more compute time and the necessity to use much larger blobs because
of the non-locality of the calibrations.  A more practical approach
would be to iterate between fitting source parameters in brick space,
and fitting calibration parameters in exposure space.  Such iterations
will be considered and tested for future data releases.
Another practical issue is that the current PSF models may allow
too much freedom.

Photometry
==========

The flux calibration for `BASS`_ and `MzLS`_ are on the AB natural system of the `90Prime`_ 
and `Mosaic-3`_ cameras, respectively.
An AB system reports the same flux in any band for a source whose spectrum is
constant in units of erg/cm\ |sup2|/Hz. A source with a spectrum of
:math:`f = 10^{-(48.6+22.5)/2.5}` erg/cm\ |sup2|/Hz
would be reported to have an integrated flux of 1 nanomaggie in any filter.
The natural system means that we have not
applied color terms to any of the photometry, but report fluxes as observed in the
`90Prime`_ and `Mosaic-3`_ filter systems.

Zero point magnitudes for the CP reductions of the `90Prime`_ and `Mosaic-3`_ images
were computed by comparing 7\ |Prime| diameter aperture photometry to Pan-STARRS-1 (PS1)
photometry, where the latter was modified with color terms
to place the PS1 photometry on the `90Prime`_ and `Mosaic-3`_ camera systems.  
The same color terms are applied to all CCDs.
Zero points are computed separately for each CCD, but not for each amplifier.
The *average* color terms to convert from PS1 to `90Prime`_ (for `BASS`_) and 
`Mosaic-3`_ (for `MzLS`_)  were computed for stars
in the color range :math:`0.4 < (g-i) < 2.7` as follows:

.. math::
               (g-i) & = & g_{\mathrm{PS}} - i_{\mathrm{PS}} \\
   g_{\mathrm{BASS}} & = & g_{\mathrm{PS}} + 0.06630 (g-i) + 0.00958 (g-i)^2 - 0.00672 (g-i)^3 \\
   r_{\mathrm{BASS}} & = & r_{\mathrm{PS}} - 0.04836 (g-i) + 0.01100 (g-i)^2 - 0.00563 (g-i)^3 \\
   z_{\mathrm{MzLS}} & = & z_{\mathrm{PS}} - 0.12315 (g-i) + 0.04608 (g-i)^2 - 0.01164 (g-i)^3 \\

The brightnesses of objects are all stored as linear fluxes in units of nanomaggies.  The 
conversion from linear fluxes to magnitudes is :math:`m = 22.5 - 2.5 \log_{10}(\mathrm{flux})`.
These linear fluxes are well-defined even at the faint end, and the errors on the linear 
fluxes should be very close to a normal distribution.  The fluxes can be negative for faint 
objects, and indeed we expect many such cases for the faintest objects.

The filter curves are available for `BASS g-band`_, `BASS r-band`_, `MzLS z-band`_ and
`MzLS z-band with corrections`_ for the telescope, corrector, camera and atmosphere 
(at airmass=1.0).
The derivation of the BASS filter responses is described on the `BASS website`_.

As of DR6, PSF photometry uses the same PSF models 
(and sky background subtraction) for zeropoint-fitting as is later used in cataloging.  
This was not the case for `DR5`_ or before.
So, starting with DR6, the measured fluxes for PS1 stars should be completely self-consistent.

DR6 also contains WISE fluxes force-photometered at the position of Legacy Survey sources.
The WISE Level 1 images and the unWISE image stacks are on a Vega system.
We have converted these to an AB system using the `recommended conversions by
the WISE team`_. Namely,
:math:`\mathrm{Flux}_{\mathrm{AB}} = \mathrm{Flux}_{\mathrm{Vega}} * 10^{-(\Delta m/2.5)}`
where :math:`\Delta m` = 2.699, 3.339, 5.174, and 6.620 mag in the W1, W2, W3 and W4 bands.
For example, a WISE W1 image should be multiplied by :math:`10^{-2.699/2.5} = 0.083253` to
give units consistent with the Tractor catalogs. These conversion factors are recorded in the
Tractor catalog headers ("WISEAB1", etc). The result is that the optical and WISE fluxes 
we provide should all be within a few percent of being on an AB system.

Galactic Extinction
===================

For DR6, we calculate Galactic extinction for `BASS`_ and `MzLS`_ as if they are on the DECam
filter system (e.g., see `DR5`_).

Eddie Schlafly has computed the extinction coefficients for the DECam filters through 
airmass=1.3. Those coefficients are 3.995, 3.214, 2.165, 1.592, 1.211, 1.064 for 
:math:`ugrizY`, and are applied to the `SFD98`_ E(B-V) values at the coordinate of 
each object.  The coefficients at different airmasses only have small changes, with 
the largest effect in :math:`g`-band where the coefficient would be 3.219
at airmass=1 and 3.202 at airmass=2.


Astrometry
==========

Our astrometry uses the `Gaia Data Release 1`_ system. Positions of sources are tied to 
predicted Gaia positions at the epoch of the corresponding Legacy Survey observation. The 
residuals are typically smaller than |plusmn|\ 0.03\ |Prime|.

Astrometric calibration of all optical Legacy Survey data is conducted using Gaia 
astrometric positions of stars matched to Pan-STARRS-1 (PS1).
The same matched objects are used for both astrometric and photometric calibration. There 
are some areas of sky where Gaia has "holes," i.e., where stars brighter than the Gaia 
magnitude limit are missing from the Gaia catalog. As a result, in
some regions of the survey there are fewer matches to a given bright magnitude limit in 
the PS1-Gaia catalog than there are in the PS1 catalog that was used for astrometric 
calibration in, e.g., `DR4`_ of the Legacy Surveys.

As of DR6, PSF photometry uses the same PSF models 
(and sky background subtraction) for zero-point-fitting as is later used in cataloging.  
This was not the case for `DR5`_ or before.
So, starting with DR6, the measured positions for Gaia stars should be completely 
self-consistent, substantially reducing any systematic errors in astrometry.


Image Stacks
============

The image stacks are provided for convenience, but were not used in the Tractor fits.
These images are oversized by approximately 260 pixels in each dimension. These are 
tangent projections centered at each brick center, North up, with dimensions of 
3600 |times| 3600 and a scale of 0.262\ |Prime|/pix.  The image stacks are computed 
using Lanczos-3 interpolation. These stacks should not be used for "precision" work.


Depths
======

The histograms below depict the median 5\ |sigma| point source (AB) depths for areas with
different numbers of observations in DR6.

.. image:: ../../files/depth-hist-g.png
    :height: 375
    :width: 570

    :width: 570
.. image:: ../../files/depth-hist-z.png
    :height: 375
    :width: 570
    :alt: DR6 Depth Plots

These histograms are based upon the formal errors in the Tractor 
catalogs for point sources, which need further confirmation. These depths can be compared 
to the predicted proposed depths for 2 observations at 1.5\ |Prime| seeing of 
:math:`g=24.7`, :math:`r=23.9`, :math:`z=23.0`.
