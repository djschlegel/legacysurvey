When using data from the Legacy Surveys in papers, please use the following acknowledgment:

This paper uses data that were obtained by The Legacy Surveys: the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS; NOAO Proposal ID # 2014B-0404; PIs: 
David Schlegel and Arjun Dey), the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey (BASS; NOAO Proposal ID # 2015A-0801; PIs: Zhou Xu and Xiaohui Fan), and the Mayall 
z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS; NOAO Proposal ID # 2016A-0453; PI: Arjun Dey). DECaLS, BASS and MzLS together include data obtained, respectively, at 
the Blanco telescope, Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO); the Bok telescope, Steward 
Observatory, University of Arizona; and the Mayall telescope, Kitt Peak National Observatory, NOAO. NOAO is operated by the Association of 
Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation. Please see 
http://legacysurvey.org for details regarding the Legacy Surveys. BASS is a key project of the Telescope Access Program (TAP), which has been 
funded by the National Astronomical Observatories of China, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (the Strategic Priority Research Program "The 
Emergence of Cosmological Structures" Grant No. XDB09000000), and the Special Fund for Astronomy from the Ministry of Finance. The BASS is 
also supported by the External Cooperation Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. 114A11KYSB20160057) and Chinese National Natural 
Science Foundation (Grant No. 11433005). The Legacy Surveys imaging of the DESI footprint is supported by the Director, Office of Science, 
Office of High Energy Physics of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH1123, and by the National Energy Research Scientific 
Computing Center, a DOE Office of Science User Facility under the same contract; and by the U.S. National Science Foundation, Division of
