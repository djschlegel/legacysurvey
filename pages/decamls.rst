The Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Blanco 4m telescope,
located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, will provide the optical
imaging for targeting for 2/3 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (`DESI`_) 
footprint, covering both the North Galactic Cap region at Dec |leq| 32\ |deg|
and the South Galactic Cap region at Dec |leq| 34\ |deg|.  Due to the
combination of large field of view and high sensitivity from 400-1000 nm, 
DECam is an efficient option for obtaining photometry in the
:math:`g`, :math:`r`, and :math:`z` bands.

DECam can reach the required depths for `DESI`_ targets in modest total
exposure times of 166, 134 and 200 sec in :math:`g`, :math:`r`, :math:`z` in median
conditions.  These data reach required 5\ |sigma| depths
of :math:`g=24.0`, :math:`r=23.4` and :math:`z=22.5` for an ELG galaxy with half-light
radius of 0.45 arcsec.  Because of the incomplete fill factor of DECam,
a 3-pass observing strategy has been designed where these depths are
met with 2 of the 3 exposures.  Accounting for weather loss,
DECam is capable of imaging 9000 deg\ |sup2| of the `DESI`_
footprint to this depth in 157 scheduled nights. 

A public survey, "The DECam Legacy Survey of the SDSS Equatorial
Sky" (PI: D. Schlegel and A. Dey), was
allocated 64 nights over three years beginning in semester 2014A
as part of the NOAO Large Surveys programs. This initial allocation
was proposed to only image the existing `SDSS-III`_ equatorial footprint.
The camera throughputs and sky brightness distribution increased
the average exposure times from an expected 50, 50, 100 seconds
to 87, 67, 100 seconds per pass.
The imaging program was supplemented to a total of 157 scheduled
nights to both account for these longer exposure times and enlarge
the footprint to the full `DESI`_ equatorial footprint.
The program completed in March, 2019.

The DECaLS program made use of other DECam data
within the `DESI`_ footprint.
The most significant of these other data sets is from
the Dark Energy Survey (`DES`_), which includes a 5000 deg\ |sup2|
contiguous area in the South Galactic Cap.
DECaLS explicitly did not re-image that area, instead incorporating
the DES imaging itself.
Data from the early DECam science verification period has a number
of problematic features, and is not included in our imaging releases.
