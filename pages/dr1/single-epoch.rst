Single-epoch Images
===================

images/YYYYMMDD/decam_<expnum>_<filter>.imag.fits
-------------------------------------------------

Calibrated CCD images used for Tractor processing.

- 60 HDUs for each of the CCDs in a full DECam exposure.
- Units are nano-maggies per pixel after applying the zero-point.
- Based upon the Community Pipeline.
- Inputs are from cosmo/work/decam/cats/CP20140810_[grz]_v2
- MAGZPT and SEEING header keywords in each hdu are from A. Dey's work.
- NOTE: The astrometric solution is that generated by the CP and used for the Sexactor catalogs; the Tractor catalogs have re-fit the astromety for each CCD, but that's not stored here.
- The units of these files are ADUs, which can be converted to fluxes using the MAGZERO header keyword, as follows:

  - :math:`m = \mathrm{MAGZPT} - 2.5 \log_{10}(\mathrm{flux}_\mathrm{ADU})`
  - :math:`\mathrm{flux}_\mathrm{nanomaggies} = \mathrm{flux}_\mathrm{ADU} \times 10^{(22.5 -\mathrm{MAGZPT})/2.5}`

images/YYYYMMDD/decam_<expnum>_<filter>.ivar.fits
-------------------------------------------------

Calibrated CCD inverse variance images used for Tractor processing.

- 60 HDUs for each of the CCDs in a full DECam exposure.
- The units are 1/ADU^2^, with the same conversion from ADU to flux as for the corresponding image.

images/YYYYMMDD/decam_<expnum>_<filter>.mask.fits.gz
----------------------------------------------------

Calibrated CCD mask images used for Tractor processing.

- 60 HDUs for each of the CCDs in a full DECam exposure.
- Generated by the Community Pipeline, with the mask bits documented
  in the "Data Quality Bit Defininitions" table in
