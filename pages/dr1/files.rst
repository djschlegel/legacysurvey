Summary files
=============

:bricks.fits: FITS binary table with the RA,DEC bounds of each geometrical "brick" on the sky
:dr1-bricks.fits: subset of bricks.fits listing the bricks included in this release
:ccds.fits: FITS binary table with almanac information about each individual CCD image
  - Copied from cosmo/work/decam/decals-ccds-CPv2.fits
:dr1-ccds.fits: subset of ccds.fits listing the CCDs that touch the area included in this release
:dr1-specz-dr12.fits: Merged photometric and spectroscopic catalog for 12,033 sources with spectroscopic redshifts from SDSS/DR12.  This is a FITS binary file with 4 extensions, each that are row-matched as follows:

  - HDU1 - DECaLS photometry and related Tractor outputs
  - HDU2 - SDSS/DR12 spectroscopy (http://data.sdss3.org/sas/dr12/sdss/spectro/redux/specObj-dr12.fits ) 
  - HDU3 - SDSS/DR12 photometry (http://data.sdss3.org/sas/dr12/sdss/spectro/redux/photoPosPlate-dr12.fits) recalibrated according to the latest (DR13) uber-calibration
  - HDU4 - WISE forced photometry (from specmatch-dr12.fits available [http://unwise.me here])

Tractor catalogs
================

:tractor/<AAA>/tractor-<brick>.fits: FITS binary table containing Tractor photometry
  - Documented here: https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DecamLegacy/TractorCatalogs

Image stacks
============

:coadd/<AAA>/decals-<brick>-ccds.fits: FITS binary table with the list of CCD images that were used in this brick.
   EXPNUM indicates the DECam exposure ID and FILTER indicates the filter (u,g,r).
:coadd/<AAA>/decals-<brick>-image-<filter>.fits: Stacked image centered on a brick location covering 0.25 x 0.25 deg
  - NOTE: These are not the images used by Tractor, which operates on the single-epoch images.
  - the primary HDU contains the coadded image (simple unweighted coadd), in units of nano-maggies per pixel.
  - the first extension HDU contains the inverse-variance map.  This is the sum of inverse-variances of the input images.
:coadd/<AAA>/decals-<brick>-model-<filter>.fits.gz: Stacked model image centered on a brick location covering 0.25 x 0.25 deg
  - the Tractor's idea of what the coadded images should look like; the Tractor's model prediction
:coadd/<AAA>/decals-<brick>-chi2-<filter>.fits: Stacked chi^2^ image, which is approximately the summed chi^2^ values from the single-epoch images
:coadd/<AAA>/decals-<file>-depth-<filter>.fits.gz: Stacked depth map in units of the point-source inverse-variance at each pixel
  - The 5-sigma point-source depth would be computed as 5 / sqrt(depth_ivar) .
:coadd/<AAA>/decals-<file>-nexp-<filter>.fits.gz: Number of exposures contributing to each pixel of the stacked images
:coadd/<AAA>/decals-<brick>-image.jpg: JPEG image of calibrated image using the g,r,z filters as the colors
:coadd/<AAA>/decals-<brick>-model.jpg: JPEG image of the Tractor's model image using the g,r,z filters as the colors

Single-epoch images
===================

:images/YYYYMMDD/decam_<expnum>_<filter>.imag.fits: Calibrated CCD images used for Tractor processing

  - 60 HDUs for each of the CCDs in a full DECam exposure.
  - Units are nano-maggies per pixel after applying the zero-point.
  - Based upon the Community Pipeline.
  - Inputs are from cosmo/work/decam/cats/CP20140810_[grz]_v2
  - MAGZPT and SEEING header keywords in each hdu are from A. Dey's work.
  - NOTE: The astrometric solution is that generated by the CP and used for the Sexactor catalogs; the Tractor catalogs have re-fit the astromety for each CCD, but that's not stored here.
  - The units of these files are ADUs, which can be converted to fluxes using the MAGZERO header keyword, as follows:

    - :math:`m = MAGZPT - 2.5 * log10(flux_{\rm ADU})`
    - :math:`flux_{\rm nanomaggies} = flux_{\rm ADU} * 10^{(22.5 - MAGZPT)/2.5}`

:images/YYYYMMDD/decam_<expnum>_<filter>.ivar.fits: Calibrated CCD inverse variance images used for Tractor processing

  - 60 HDUs for each of the CCDs in a full DECam exposure.
  - The units are 1/ADU^2^, with the same conversion from ADU to flux as for the corresponding image.

:images/YYYYMMDD/decam_<expnum>_<filter>.mask.fits.gz: Calibrated CCD mask images used for Tractor processing

  - 60 HDUs for each of the CCDs in a full DECam exposure.
  - Generated by the Community Pipeline, with the mask bits documented in the "Data Quality Bit Defininitions" table in http://www.noao.edu/noao/staff/fvaldes/CPDocPrelim/PL201_3.html
