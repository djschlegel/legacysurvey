Legacy Survey observations began in August 2014. For each of the Legacy Surveys 
(`BASS`_, `DECaLS`_ and `MzLS`_) each position in the sky (minus some small filling factor)
will be observed in three "passes" in each of three filters (:math:`g`, :math:`r`, :math:`z`).
"Pass 1" is observed in photometric, good-seeing conditions.
"Pass 2" and "Pass 3" are observed in progressively worse conditions.
This strategy will ensure a photometric solution across the full survey area.

In addition to observations carried out as part of the Legacy Survey, data releases will include
reductions of data from other programs in (:math:`g`, :math:`r`, :math:`z`) that overlap the 
Legacy Survey footprint.

The images below depict the status of the survey in each band as of Data Release 4 (DR4), 
color-coded by the number of passes. `DESI`_ area that is yet to be observed is
marked in light gray. The lines track Galactic latitudes of 0\ |deg|, -10\ |deg| and +10\ |deg|.
