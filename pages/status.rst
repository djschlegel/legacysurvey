.. slug: status

The DECam Legacy Survey observations began in August 2014.  Each position in the sky
will be observed in three "passes" in each of three filters (g, r, z).
"Pass 1" is observed in photometric, good-seeing conditions.
"Pass 2" and "Pass 3" are observed in progressively worse conditions.
This strategy will ensure a photometric solution across the full survey area.

In addition to the DECam Legacy observations, data releases will include
reductions of data from other programs in the same filters that overlap this footprint.
The image below depicts the status of the survey as of early December 2015.
