This data release's gallery highlights galaxy clusters,
distant systems containing tens to thousands of individual galaxies and usually containing
a single, large, dominant galaxy at the very center.  The sample presented here is taken
from the `redMaPPer/v6.3`_ cluster catalog.

The diameter of each image cutout equals 400 kiloparsecs (more than 1.2 million light-years) at the
redshift of the cluster.  The clusters are sorted by increasing richness or dark matter halo mass,
ranging between approximately :math:`3\times10^{15}` solar masses (top, left-hand side of the page)
to :math:`1\times10^{14}` solar masses (bottom-right).

The object name below each thumbnail links to the `Sky Viewer`_,
and the horizontal white bar in the lower-right corner of each image represents 15 arcseconds.
