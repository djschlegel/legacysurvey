The Legacy Surveys are producing an inference model of the 14,000 square degrees
of extragalactic sky visible from the northern hemisphere in three optical bands
(:math:`g,r,z`) and four infrared bands.  The sky coverage is approximately bounded by
-18\ |deg| < |delta| < +84\ |deg| in celestial coordinates and :math:`|b|` > 18\
|deg| in Galactic coordinates. To achieve this goal, the Legacy Surveys are conducting
3 imaging projects on different telescopes, described in more depth at the following links:

Contents of DR5
===============

Data Release 5 (DR5) is the fifth public data release of the Legacy Surveys. It is the
fourth public data release of images and catalogs from the DECam Legacy Survey (`DECaLS`_;
DR4 comprised the first release of data from `BASS`_ and `MzLS`_). 
DR5 imaging is first reduced through the `NOAO Community Pipeline`_ before being processed 
using the `Tractor`_.

Images from `DECaLS`_
:math:`g,r,z`-band observations (NOAO survey program 0404; https://www.noao.edu/perl/abstract?2014B-0404)
are included from August 2014 through May 2017. DR5 also includes DECam data from a range of 
non-DECaLS surveys, including observations that were conducted from September 2012 to May 2017.

In total, the optical data covers a disjoint footprint
with, roughly, 7400 deg\ |sup2| having at least one observation
in :math:`g`-band, 8000 deg\ |sup2| having at least one observation
in :math:`r`-band and 10200 deg\ |sup2| having at least one observation
in :math:`z`-band. A total of 6800 deg\ |sup2| is covered by at least one observation in 
*all three* optical filters.

There are approximately 680 million unique sources in DR5 spread over 176,811 bricks.

DR5 includes the stacked images and the Tractor-based catalogs.
The size of the DR5 data distribution is:

For all of the Legacy Surveys, including `DECaLS`_, co-added images and 
`Tractor`_ catalogs are presented in "bricks" of approximate
size 0.25\ |deg| |times| 0.25\ |deg|.  Each brick is defined in terms of a box in RA,Dec
coordinates.  For the image stacks, we use a simple tangent-plane (WCS TAN)
projection around the brick center. The projections for the :math:`g,r,z` filters are identical.  
There are 662,174 bricks spread over the sky, meaning that each brick has an average
area of 0.0623 deg\ :sup:`2`\ . The brick images have some overlap.
The co-added images should be
used with caution, as noted below in the *Image Stacks* section.


Obtaining Images and Raw Data
==============================

Images, for all 3 of the Legacy Surveys can be viewed 
directly using `the Sky viewer`_
and raw data can be obtained through `the NOAO portal`_ (or via ftp; see also the information near
the bottom of the `files`_ page).

Sections of `DECaLS`_ for DR5 can be obtained as JPEGs or FITS files using
the cutout service, as follows:

JPEG: http://legacysurvey.org/viewer/jpeg-cutout?ra=190.1086&dec=1.2005&layer=decals-dr5&pixscale=0.27&bands=grz

FITS: http://legacysurvey.org/viewer/fits-cutout?ra=190.1086&dec=1.2005&layer=decals-dr5&pixscale=0.27&bands=grz

where "bands" is a string such as ":math:`grz`",":math:`gz`",":math:`g`", etc.  As of the 
writing of this documentation the maximum size for cutouts (in number of pixels) is 512.
Pixscale=0.262 will return (approximately) the native pixels used by the `Tractor`_.
For information on how to recover `BASS`_ and `MzLS`_ cutouts, see the `DR4 description`_ page.

Source Detection
================

The source detection uses a PSF- and SED-matched-filter detection on
the stacked images, with a 6\ |sigma| detection limit.
The `Tractor`_ fitting step is initialized with these positions, although
these positions can be changed during the fits and
low-S/N sources can be removed.

For source detection, each image is convolved by its PSF model,
then a weighted stack
of these is created in order to optimize the point-source detection
efficiency.  Next, SED-matched combinations of the three bands are
created, for two SEDs: "flat" (a source with AB color zero), and
"red", a source with AB color :math:`g-r = 1`, :math:`r-z = 1`.  Sources above 6\ |sigma|
are detected in each of these two SED-matched filters, as well as in each band independently.

As of DR5, source detection is run first in :math:`z`, then in :math:`r`, :math:`g`, "flat"
and finally in "red". In `DR4`_, `DR3`_ and earlier data releases, 
source detection was run first in :math:`g`, then in :math:`r`, :math:`z`, "flat"
and finally in "red".

PSF
===

The Tractor makes use of the PSF on each individual exposure. The PSF for 
the individual exposures are first computed independently for each CCD
using PSFEx_, generating spatially-varying pixelized models.

The configuaration files for SExtractor and PSFex that we used for a given
iteration of our codebase are available `on our github page`_.

Sky Level
=========

The Community Pipeline removes a sky level that includes a sky pattern, an illumination correction,
and a single scaled fringe pattern. These steps are described on the `NOAO Community Pipeline`_
page.
This makes the sky level in the processed images near zero, and removes most pattern artifacts.
A constant sky level is then added back to the image that is the mean of what was removed.

Additionally, we compute and remove a spatially varying (spline) sky
model, by detecting and masking sources, then computing medians in
sliding 512-pixel boxes. The stacked images have this sky level
removed.

Tractor Catalogs
================

The Tractor code runs within the geometrical region
of a brick. This fitting is performed on the individual exposures
that overlap the brick, without making use of the image stacks.
This preserves the full information content of the data set in the fits,
handles masked pixels without the need for uncertain interpolation techniques,
and fits to data points without the complication of pixel covariances.

Morphological Classification
============================

The Tractor fitting can allow any of the source properties or
image calibration parameters (such as the PSF) to float.
Only the source properties were allowed to float in DR5.
These are continuous properties for the object centers, fluxes,
and the shape parameters. There is also the discrete choice of which
model type to use. In DR5, five morphological types are used: point sources,
round exponential galaxies with a variable radius ("REX"), deVaucouleurs profiles
(elliptical galaxies), exponential profiles (spiral galaxies), and composite
profiles that are deVaucouleurs + exponential (with the same source center).
The total numbers of the different morphological types in DR5 are:

================= ==================
Number of Sources Type
================= ==================
   679,755,904    Objects in a Primary brick
   371,088,269    ``PSF``
   222,184,611    ``REX``
    61,380,049    ``EXP``
    22,036,854    ``DEV``
     3,066,121    ``COMP``
================= ==================

Note that the "REX" model replaces the "SIMP" model used in 
`DR4`_, `DR3`_ and earlier data releases.

The decision to retain an object in the catalog and to re-classify it using
models more complicated than a point source is made using the penalized
changes to |chi|\ |sup2| in the image after subtracting the models for
other sources.
The "PSF" and "REX" models are computed for
every source and the better of these two is used when deciding whether to keep
the source. A source is retained if its penalized |chi|\ |sup2| is improved by 25;
this corresponds to a |chi|\ |sup2| difference of 27 (because of the penalty
of 2 for the source centroid).  Sources below this threshold are removed.
The source is classified as the better of "point source (PSF)" or "round exponential galaxy (REX)"
unless the penalized |chi|\ |sup2|
is improved by 9 (*i.e.*, approximately a 3\ |sigma| improvement) by treating
it as a deVaucouleurs or exponential profile.
The classification is a composite of deVaucouleurs + exponential if it is both a
better fit to a single profile over the point source, and the composite improves
the penalized |chi|\ |sup2| by another 9.  These choices implicitly mean
that any extended source classifications have to be at least 5.8\ |sigma| detections
and that composite profiles must be at least 6.5\ |sigma| detections.

The fluxes are not constrained to be positive-valued.  This allows
the fitting of very low signal-to-noise sources without introducing
biases at the faint end.  It also allows the stacking of fluxes
at the catalog level.


Tractor Implementation Details
==============================

Tractor fundamentally treats the fitting as a |chi|\ |sup2| minimization
problem.  The current core routine uses the sparse least squares
solver from the `SciPy`_ package, or the open source
`Ceres solver`_, originally developed by Google.

The galaxy profiles (the exponential and deVaucouleurs profiles mentioned above
under *Morphological Classification*) are approximated
with `mixture-of-gaussian`_ (MoG) models
and are convolved by the pixelized PSF models using a new Fourier-space
method (Lang, in prep).
The galaxy profile approximation introduces errors in these
models typically at the level of :math:`10^{-4}` or smaller.
The PSF models are treated as pixel-convolved quantities,
and are evaluated at the integral pixel coordinates without integrating
any functions over the pixels.

The Tractor algorithm could be run with both the source parameters
and the calibration parameters allowed to float, at the cost of
more compute time and the necessity to use much larger blobs because
of the non-locality of the calibrations.  A more practical approach
would be to iterate between fitting source parameters in brick space,
and fitting calibration parameters in exposure space.  Such iterations
will be considered and tested for future data releases.
Another practical issue is that the current PSF models may allow
too much freedom.

Photometry
==========

The flux calibration for `DECaLS`_ is on the AB natural system of the DECam instrument.
An AB system reports the same flux in any band for a source whose spectrum is
constant in units of erg/cm\ |sup2|/Hz. A source with a spectrum of
:math:`f = 10^{-(48.6+22.5)/2.5}` erg/cm\ |sup2|/Hz
would be reported to have an integrated flux of 1 nanomaggie in any filter.
The natural system means that we have not
applied color terms to any of the photometry, but report fluxes as observed in the DECam filters.

Zero point magnitudes for the CP version 2 reductions of the DECam images
were computed by comparing 7\ |Prime| diameter aperture photometry to PS1
photometry, where the latter was modified with color terms
to place the PS1 photometry on the DECam system.  The same color terms
are applied to all CCDs.
Zero points are computed separately for each CCD, but not for each amplifier.
The color terms to convert from PS1 to DECam were computed for stars
in the color range :math:`0.4 < (g-i) < 2.7` as follows:


.. math::
                (g-i) & = & g_{\mathrm{PS}} - i_{\mathrm{PS}} \\
   g_{\mathrm{DECam}} & = & g_{\mathrm{PS}} + 0.04709 (g-i) + 0.00084 (g-i)^2 - 0.00340 (g-i)^3 \\
   r_{\mathrm{DECam}} & = & r_{\mathrm{PS}} - 0.09939 (g-i) + 0.04509 (g-i)^2 - 0.01488 (g-i)^3 \\
   z_{\mathrm{DECam}} & = & z_{\mathrm{PS}} - 0.13404 (g-i) + 0.06591 (g-i)^2 - 0.01695 (g-i)^3 \\

The brightnesses of objects are all stored as linear fluxes in units of nanomaggies.  The conversion
from linear fluxes to magnitudes is :math:`m = 22.5 - 2.5 \log_{10}(\mathrm{flux})`. These linear fluxes 
are well-defined even at the faint end, and the errors on the linear fluxes should
be very close to a normal distribution.  The fluxes can be negative for faint objects, and indeed we
expect many such cases for the faintest objects.

DR5 also contains WISE fluxes force-photometered at the position of Legacy Survey sources.
The WISE Level 1 images and the unWISE image stacks are on a Vega system.
We have converted these to an AB system using the `recommended conversions by
the WISE team`_. Namely,
:math:`\mathrm{Flux}_{\mathrm{AB}} = \mathrm{Flux}_{\mathrm{Vega}} * 10^{-(\Delta m/2.5)}`
where :math:`\Delta m` = 2.699, 3.339, 5.174, and 6.620 mag in the W1, W2, W3 and W4 bands.
For example, a WISE W1 image should be multiplied by :math:`10^{-2.699/2.5} = 0.083253` to
give units consistent with the Tractor catalogs. These conversion factors are recorded in the
Tractor catalog headers ("WISEAB1", etc). The result is that 
the DECam and WISE fluxes we provide should all be within a few percent of being on an AB system.

Galactic Extinction
===================

Eddie Schlafly has computed the extinction coefficients for the DECam filters through airmass=1.3.
Those coefficients are 3.995, 3.214, 2.165, 1.592, 1.211, 1.064 for :math:`ugrizY`, and are applied
to the `SFD98`_ E(B-V) values at the coordinate of each object.  The coefficients at different airmasses
only change by a small amount, with the largest effect in :math:`g`-band where the coefficient would 
be 3.219 at airmass=1 and 3.202 at airmass=2.


Astrometry
==========

Our astrometry uses the `Gaia Data Release 1`_ system. Positions of sources are tied to predicted Gaia positions at
the epoch of the corresponding Legacy Survey observation. The residuals are typically smaller than |plusmn|\ 0.03\ |Prime|.

Astrometric calibration of `DECaLS`_ data is conducted using Gaia astrometric positions of stars matched to Pan-STARRS-1 (PS1). 
The same matched objects are used for both astrometric and photometric calibration. There are some areas of sky where Gaia 
has "holes," i.e., where stars brighter than the Gaia magnitude limit are missing from the Gaia catalog. As a result, in 
some regions of the survey there are fewer matches to a given bright magnitude limit in the PS1-Gaia catalog than there 
are in the PS1 catalog that was used for astrometric calibration in, e.g., `DR3`_ of the Legacy Surveys.


Image Stacks
============

The image stacks are provided for convenience, but were not used in the Tractor fits.
These images are oversized by approximately 260 pixels in each dimension.
These are tangent projections centered at each brick center, North up, with dimensions of 3600 |times| 3600
and a scale of 0.262\ |Prime|/pix.  The image stacks are computed using Lanczos-3
interpolation. These stacks should not be used for "precision" work.


Depths
======

As of `DR2`_ of the Legacy Surveys, the median 5\ |sigma| point source (AB) depths for areas with 3 observations 
in DECaLS was :math:`g=24.65`, :math:`r=23.61`, :math:`z=22.84`. DR5 should reach similar depths.
This is based upon the formal errors in the Tractor catalogs for point sources; those 
errors need further confirmation. This can be compared to the predicted proposed 
depths for 2 observations at 1.5\ |Prime| seeing of :math:`g=24.7`, :math:`r=23.9`, :math:`z=23.0`.
