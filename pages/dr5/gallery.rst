This gallery highlights some of the galaxy groups in the DR5 footprint.
The groups were identified using an input catalog of galaxies with an
apparent angular diameter greater than 24 arcsec and a friends-of-friends
algorithm with a linking length of 2.5 arcmin. The color mosaics were
generated using `trilogy.py`_. Each thumbnail links to a larger image while
the galaxy names below the thumbnails link to the `Sky Viewer`_.
For reference, the horizontal white bar in each image represents 30 arcsec.
