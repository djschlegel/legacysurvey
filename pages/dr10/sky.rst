For DR10 of the Legacy Surveys, sky corrections were `only` applied in the :math:`z\hbox{-}\mathrm{band}`. A few additional changes were also incorporated.

We are working on documenting these additional changes. For now, it might be helpful to consult the `DR9 page about the sky pattern correction`_.
