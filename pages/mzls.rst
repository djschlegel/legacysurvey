The Mayall :math:`z`-band Legacy Survey (MzLS) imaged the 
Dec |geq| 32\ |deg| region of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (`DESI`_)
footprint. It used the MOSAIC-3 camera at the prime focus of the 4-meter
Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. MzLS was scheduled over
230 nights during semesters 2016A and 2017A through an agreement
between the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.
The imaging camera underwent a major upgrade in 2015 to improve
its :math:`z`-band efficiency.
The KPNO 4m telescope control system and the imaging camera
software were upgraded for improved operational efficiency.
NOAO purchased a new :math:`z`-band filter to match the DECam filter
bandpass and to thereby minimize any differences between the `DECaLs`_
and MOSAIC :math:`z`-band surveys.

The MOSAIC-3 camera is a new version of the prime focus imaging
system. This upgrade made use of the dewar from the MOSAIC-2
camera at CTIO and the MOSAIC-1.1 mechanical system and guider
from KPNO. Yale University designed and built a new cold plate for the dewar
which it populated with four super-thick (00\ |mu|\ m-thick) fully depleted
4096\ |sup2| pixel CCDs with the same 15 micron pitch.
The readout system consists of four DESI controllers, one
for each CCD that simultaneously reads the four quadrants of each device.
These controllers were modified to synchronize to a single clock.
The dewar was delivered to NOAO in September 2015 where it
was integrated with the MOSAIC-1.1 mechanical enclosure,
shutter, filter wheel and acquisition and guider system.
This upgraded camera, christened MOSAIC-3, saw first light in
October 2015 and underwent further on-sky commissioning runs in 
November and December 2015. The :math:`z`-band efficiency has
been measured to be improved by 60% as compared to the MOSAIC-1.1 camera.

The MzLS survey tiles the sky in three passes, similar to
the `DECaLS`_ survey strategy.  At least one of these passes
was observed in both photometric conditions and in seeing
conditions better than 1.3 arcsec.

MzLS  began  official  survey  operations  on  February  2,  2016,  and  ended  on  February  12,  2018.
During this period,  MzLS used a total of 382.7 nights,  276.8 of which were clear enough to allow
observations.
